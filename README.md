### About Rancid Tomatoes
Rancid Tomatoes is a project building an application for users to sign in and rate movies. The application features fetch calls to a back end API and Redux magic featuring React components and front end testing using Jest and Enzyme. The project took about a week and all the team members ended up great friends in the end.

### Learning Goals
- Reinforce React fundamentals
- Reinforce using React Router to create a multi-page user experience
- Reinforce component and asynchronous JS testing
- Work with and navigate a shared, persistent API using GET, POST, and DELETE requests
- Implement Redux as the appâ€™s place to store shared state
- Test Redux functions
